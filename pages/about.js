      <p className="pre">
AutoBooked AI started with a simple belief: good businesses shouldn’t struggle to get conversations.
We kept seeing owners spend on ads and tools, then spend their evenings chasing leads. It’s exhausting.

We built a service that keeps the important part simple: put qualified conversations on your calendar, every week.

What we do
• We learn who your best customers are and the offers that get them to say “yes” to a call.
• We start respectful outreach across email, LinkedIn and SMS.
• We handle replies like a switched‑on SDR and book meetings straight into your calendar.
• We keep it honest with short weekly summaries and clear next steps.

How we work with you
1) Strategy call — clear ICP, offers and outcomes.
2) Set‑up — sending domains/inboxes, tracking and calendar routing.
3) Launch — conversations begin; we escalate high‑intent threads to you quickly.
4) Improve — weekly tweaks to targeting, scripts and reminders to lift show‑rates.

What matters to us
• Clarity — plain language, realistic expectations, no fluff.
• Respect — no spammy blasts that burn your brand.
• Useful data — reports that help you make decisions.
• Accountability — we show our work and own outcomes.

If you want a reliable pipeline without hiring a full‑time team, we’d love to help.
Book a quick call and we’ll map out what the first 30 days can look like for your business.
